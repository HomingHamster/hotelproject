\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to create a prototype hotel booking system
that follows all usability pricipals. Careful attention was to be paid to
the general layouts and navigation parts of the website.

We were to carry a full task analysis, create a full prototype and discuss
general issues and improvements on what we had created at the end of the 
project.
